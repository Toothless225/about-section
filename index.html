                <p>The word crochet is derived from the French word crochet, a diminutive of croche, in turn from the Germanic croc, both
                meaning "hook".[3] It was used in 17th-century French lace-making, where the term crochetage designated a stitch used to
                join separate pieces of lace. The word crochet subsequently came to describe both the specific type of textile, and the
                hooked needle used to produce it.To make cloth or clothing by connecting wool or other thread into joined rows using a single needle with a hook.</p>
